To Do List Application with Drag-and-Drop Feature 📝✨
Our To Do list application makes task management a breeze with its intuitive drag-and-drop functionality. Here’s a snapshot of how it works:
Task Creation: 🆕

Users can easily add new tasks by filling out a form with details like the task title, description, and tags.

Each task is assigned a status: "To Do," "Doing," or "Done."

Drag-and-Drop Interface: 🎯📦

Status Management: 🔄

Users can drag tasks between columns ("To Do," "Doing," and "Done") to update their status. This helps in tracking the progress of tasks seamlessly.

Priority Management: 📈📉

Within each column, users can drag tasks up or down to reorder them based on priority. This allows tasks to be arranged from most to least important.

Persistent Storage: 💾🔒

Task data is saved locally or in a database, ensuring that the tasks and their order are maintained even after refreshing the page.

How It Works: 🚀
Creating Tasks: ✍️

Fill in the task details using the input form and submit. The task appears in the "To Do" column.

Managing Task Status: 🏗️

Drag a task card from "To Do" to "Doing" when you start working on it.

Once the task is completed, drag it from "Doing" to "Done."

Reordering Tasks: 🔢

Within any status column, drag tasks to reorder them according to their priority. For example, move a more urgent task to the top of the list.

Key Features: ⭐
User-Friendly Interface: 👥

The drag-and-drop functionality offers an interactive and intuitive way to manage tasks.

Visual Feedback: 👀

Visual cues during dragging highlight potential drop areas, making the process seamless.

Responsive Design: 📱💻

By incorporating these features, the To Do list application provides a robust tool for organizing and prioritizing tasks efficiently and effectively. This functionality is designed to enhance productivity by making task management straightforward and visually intuitive. 😊
